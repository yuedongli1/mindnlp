def matmul(z1: Tensor, z2: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    """
    Returns the matrix product of two dual-valued tensors.

    Note:
        Numpy arguments `out`, `casting`, `order`, `subok`, `signature`, and `extobj` are
        not supported.
        The supported dtypes are np.float16, and np.float32

    Args:
        z1 (Tensor): Input tensor, scalar not allowed.
          The last dimension of `z1` must be the same size as the second last dimension of `z2`.
          The shape of the tensor must be :math:`(2, *, ..., *)`. And the shape of z1 and z2 could be broadcast.
        z2 (Tensor): Input tensor, scalar not allowed.
          The last dimension of `z1` must be the same size as the second last dimension of `z2`.
          The shape of the tensor must be :math:`(2, *, ..., *)`. And the shape of z1 and z2 could be broadcast.

    Returns:
        Tensor of shape :math:`(2, *, ..., *)`, the matrix product of the inputs.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the last dimension of `z1` is not the same size as the
            second-to-last dimension of `z2`, or if a scalar value is passed in.
        ValueError: If the shape of `z1` and `z2` could not broadcast together.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

        >>> z = matmul(z1, z2)
