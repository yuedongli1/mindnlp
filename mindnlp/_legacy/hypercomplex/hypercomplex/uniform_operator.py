class _UniformOperator(Cell):
    r"""
    Base class for layers that operate with the second-order hypercomplex numbers, and are designed
    using the bridge pattern.

    Constructs the object of the 'hc_op' type, passing 'hc_impl' as a parameter.

    Args:
        hc_op (Type): The abstraction part of the bridge pattern.
        hc_impl (Type): The implementor part of the bridge pattern.
        **kwargs (dict): Additional arguments that may be required to construct the specific layer

    Inputs:
        - **inp** (Tensor) - input tensor. The shape is specific to the subclass.

    Outputs:
        Tensor of shape, which is specific to the subclass.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
