class _DenseImpl(BaseDenseImpl):
    r"""
    The implementor class of the dense connected layer for double numbers in normal representation.

    Applies double-valued matrix multiplication for dense connected layer. This layer implements the operation as:

    .. math::
        \begin{align}
        \text{X(out)} = \text{X(inp)} * \text{X(kernel)} + \text{Y(inp)} * \text{Y(kernel)}\\
        \text{Y(out)} = \text{X(inp)} * \text{Y(kernel)} + \text{Y(inp)} * \text{X(kernel)},
        \end{align}

    where :math:`inp` is the double input tensors, :math:`\text{kernel}` is a double weight matrix with the same
    data type as the :math:`inp` created by the layer, and :math:`\text{bias}` is a double bias vector with the same
    data type as the :math:`inp` created by the layer (only if has_bias is True). :math:`\text{X(...)}` and
    :math:`\text{Y(...)}` are respectively the first and the second parts of the double-valued expression
    inside the parentheses.

    Args:
        weight_init (Union[Tensor, str, Initializer, numbers.Number]): The trainable weight_init parameter. The dtype
            is same as `inp`. The values of str refer to the function `initializer`. Default: 'normal'.
        weight_shape (tuple): The set of int numbers that defines the shape of real and imaginary parts of the kernel.
        **factory_kwargs (dict): Extra parameters which may be needed by specific subclasses.

    Inputs:
        - **matmul_op** (Callable) - the function of the real-valued matrix multiplication to be used for decomposition
          of the complex linear transformation. Usually, mindspore.ops.operations.MatMul(...) is passed
        - **real** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape :math:`(*, in\_channels)`, which defines the real part of the input.
        - **double** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape :math:`(*, in\_channels)`, which defines the imaginary part of the
          input.

    Outputs:
        Tuple of two tensors, each of shape :math:`(*, out\_channels)`, which represents the real and the imaginary
        parts of the output.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
