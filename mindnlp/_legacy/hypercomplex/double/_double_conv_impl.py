class _ConvImpl(BaseConvImpl):
    r"""
    The implementor class of the convolution layer for double numbers in regular representation.

    Applies double-valued convolution transformation. This layer implements the operation as:

    .. math::
        \begin{align}
        \text{Re(ccor)} = \text{ccor}(\text{Re(kernel)}, \text{Re(inp)})
        + \text{ccor}(\text{Db(kernel)}, \text{Db(inp)})\\
        \text{Du(ccor)} = \text{ccor}(\text{Db(kernel)}, \text{Re(inp)})
        + \text{ccor}(\text{Re(kernel)}, \text{Db(inp)}),
        \end{align}

    where and :math:`ccor` is the real-valued `cross-correlation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation>`_,
    :math:`inp` is the double input tensors, :math:`\text{kernel}` is a double weight matrix with the same
    data type as the :math:`inp` created by the layer. :math:`\text{Re(...)}` and :math:`\text{Db(...)}`
    are respectively the first and the second parts of the double-valued expression inside the parentheses in the
    regular form.

    Args:
        weight_init (Union[Tensor, str, Initializer, numbers.Number]): The trainable weight_init parameter. The dtype
            is same as `inp`. The values of str refer to the function `initializer`. Default: 'normal'.
        weight_shape (tuple): The set of int numbers that defines the shape of real and double parts of the kernel.

    Inputs:
        - **conv_op** (Callable) - the function of the real-valued convolution to be used for decomposition
          of the double convolution transformation. For example, mindspore.ops.operations.Conv2D(...) may be passed
        - **real** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape :math:`(N, C_{in}, *, ..., *)` or :math:`(N, *, ..., *, C_{in})`,
          which defines the first part of the input.
        - **double** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape :math:`(N, C_{in}, *, ..., *)` or :math:`(N, *, ..., *, C_{in})`,
          which defines the second part of the input.

    Outputs:
        Tuple of two tensors, each of shape :math:`(N, C_{out}, *, ..., *)` or :math:`(N, *, ..., *, C_{out})`,
        which represents both the first and the second parts of the output.
