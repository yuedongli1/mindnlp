class J1J2ReLU(nn.Cell):
    r"""
    Rectified Linear Unit activation function for double-valued input in the diagonal representation.

    Applies ReLU activation layer for the double-valued input. This layer first converts the input to the regular form:

    .. math::
        \begin{align}
        \text{Re(inp)} = 0.5 * (\text{X(inp)} + \text{Y(inp)})\\
        \text{Db(inp)} = 0.5 * (\text{X(inp)} - \text{Y(inp)}),
        \end{align}

     then applies the element-wise :math:`\max(0, x)` for both real and double parts of the input tensor independently:

     .. math::
        \begin{align}
        \text{Re(out)} = (Re(inp))^+ = \max(0, Re(inp))\\
        \text{Db(out)} = (Db(inp))^+ = \max(0, Db(inp)),
        \end{align}

     and finally transfers the result back to the diagonal representation:

    .. math::
        \begin{align}
        \text{X(out)} = \text{Re(out)} + \text{Db(out)}\\
        \text{Y(out)} = \text{Re(out)} - \text{Db(out)}
        \end{align}

    Inputs:
        - **inp** (Tensor) - The input of ReLU is a Tensor of shape (2, *, ..., *). The data type is
          `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore.html#mindspore.dtype>`_ .

    Outputs:
        Tensor, with the same type and shape as the `inp`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If dtype of `inp` is not a number.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``
